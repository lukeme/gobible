# Go Bible Project #

Go Bible consists of two main components:

  * GoBibleCore - Engine that runs on **Java ME** mobile phones.
  * GoBibleCreator - Tool that runs on **Java SE** for combining Bible texts and GoBibleCore into a phone application.

Both components use the GoBibleDataFormat.

The Go Bible source code has been placed in the public domain. Read more about the GoBibleLicense.
