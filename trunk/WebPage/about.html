<h3>Who?</h3></a>
<p>
Go Bible was started in July 2003 by Jolon Faichney but has sinced grown into a large collaborative effort of people translating, maintaining, supporting, and coding. See the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> for more information about the main contributors.
</p>

<a name="availability">
<h3>Availability</h3></a>

<p>
Go Bible is placed into the public domain just like the KJV. I couldn't imagine charging for something that helps spread the Gospel. However, in the future I may release versions that use translations that require license fees. For such versions, I will pass the license fee onto the user. However, I never intend to charge for versions of Go Bible that use translations with no licensing fees.
</p>

<a name="limitations">
<h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
To jump to a verse the <i>Go to</i> screen requires that a phone have left and right arrows. Most Java phones have left and right arrows however I have noticed that some cheaper Nokias only have up and down arrows. If your phone doesn't have left and right arrows then the * and # keys can be used instead. In addition the book, chapter, and verse can be changed by pressing the following keys whilst viewing a verse:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: 1 and 4</li>
<li>Chapter: 2 and 5</li>
<li>Verse: 3 and 6</li>

</ul>

<p>
The search feature currently returns only the first 200 matches as some phones will run out of memory when more are returned.
