# Go Bible #

Bible software for mobile phones written in Java for Java ME (MIDP 2.0)

The most up-to-date documentation is now on the CrossWire Developers' wiki. See the [Go Bible](http://crosswire.org/wiki/Projects:Go_Bible) project page.

Some of the wiki pages here in Google code are now somewhat out of date.

The Go Bible development environment consists of two components: GoBibleCore and GoBibleCreator.

GoBibleCore is the JavaME application for viewing Bible texts, however it does not contain any Bible data. To produce a Go Bible application GoBibleCreator is used to convert ThML or OSIS Bible texts into GoBibleDataFormat which is packaged with the Go Bible application (GoBibleCore).

If you are only interested in producing a new translation then GoBibleCreator should be sufficient. If you are interested in enhancing the Go Bible application then you will need to check out the GoBibleCore source code.

If you are interested in writing some other software that uses Go Bible data files then check out the GoBibleDataFormat.

Note on license: Even though the Google code project indicates that the source code is under the New BSD License, all of the original source files hosted in these Google code pages were placed by Jolon in the public domain. Read more about the GoBibleLicense.

Comments added to the wiki pages are not monitored, and so will not receive a quick response.  If you require a response, please post your question in the [Go Bible Forum](http://jolon.org/vanillaforum/).

## The CrossWire Go Bible Project ##

2008-09-19 The [CrossWire Bible Society](http://crosswire.org/) has adopted Go Bible as its Java ME platform. See [Go Bible Dev](http://groups.google.com/group/go-bible-dev).

2009-02-28 GoBibleCore and GoBibleCreator source code was transferred to the [CrossWire SVN Repository](https://crosswire.org/svn/gobible/). All subsequent code development will be done using the CrossWire server, under the GNU General Public License V2.

2009-10-02 Release of GoBibleCreator version 2.3.6

2009-10-18 I have hidden the source tab here, since the code is now hosted by CrossWire.
