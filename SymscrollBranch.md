## Introduction ##

Daniel is working on a branch of GoBibleCore and GoBibleCreator. The branch is called  **symscroll** and is hosted on the CrossWire SVN server.


### Details (Core) ###

This part of the code branch is substantially completed, apart from more extensive testing.

  1. Symmetric scrolling. Pressing 'up' goes up by one screen, and pressing 'down' goes down by one screen. This should be much more intuitive than the previous method.
  1. Touchscreen support. For the few out there using the dying breed of phones that support both Java and touchscreens, this branch is for you. For touchscreen phones with a hardware menu button, you can safely get rid of the on-screen keypad and retain full functionality.
  1. Psalm titles
  1. Text added in by translators can now be marked up, provided the original sources have them.
  1. Verse numbers in other numeral representations.
  1. Search next feature allows you to search from a particular point in the text.

### Details (Creator) ###

This aspect of the code branch is still at an early stage. The aim is to enhance GoBIbleCreator to fully support all the new features.
