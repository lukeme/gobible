= Introduction =

Anyone wishing to check in new source text files must be quite clear about *copyright* ownership. 


== Details ==

Only check in texts that are known to be in the *public domain*,
or if you have *express written permission* from the copyright owner, lodged where this permission can be verified by anyone auditing the IP trail. Any source text files not conforming to this requirement will be summarily removed.
