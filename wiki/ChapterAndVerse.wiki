Using numeric keys for chapter and verse in Go to

= Introduction =

An undocumented feature of Go Bible is that you can use the numeric keys to enter chapter and verse value during "Go to", providing the cursor is highlighting one of these items.

If you enter numbers that are in range, this works as soon as you click "Go to" again.
If you enter a number that is out of range, the current passage remains selected.
