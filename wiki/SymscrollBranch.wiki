== Introduction ==

Daniel is working on a branch of GoBibleCore and GoBibleCreator. The branch is called  *symscroll* and is hosted on the !CrossWire SVN server.


=== Details ===

  #. Symmetric scrolling. Pressing 'up' goes up by one screen, and pressing 'down' goes down by one screen. This should be much more intuitive than the previous method.
  #. Touchscreen support. For the few out there using the dying breed of phones that support both Java and touchscreens, this branch is for you. For touchscreen phones with a hardware menu button, you can safely get rid of the on-screen keypad and retain full functionality.
  #. Psalm titles
  #. Text added in by translators can now be marked up, provided the original sources have them.
  #. Verse numbers in other numeral representations.
  #. Search next feature allows you to search from a particular point in the text.
