=== Enhancements and improvements ===

  * Combine two Bible translations/versions into one application, with synchronized scrolling/navigation, and use the # key to switch between them

=== Traceability ===

=== Ports to other mobile platforms? ===
  * A version of Go Bible for the [http://code.google.com/android/ Android] platform, possibly by means of [http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/j2ab J2ME Android Bridge] 
  * A version of Go Bible for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry BlackBerry] platform, which uses a proprietary application framework derived from Java, but not identical to Java ME.

=== Go Bible Creator ===
==== Implemented ====
  * ~~Enhance GoBibleCreator to build directly from USFM files, in addition to the existing ThML and OSIS formats.~~ _This task is now complete, and available in version 2.3.2_
  * ~~Provide support for alternative icon and application title, where the existing ones may present a cultural stumbling block.~~ _This task is now complete, and available in version 2.3.2_
  * ~~Update GoBibleCreator to build directly from USFM files that conform to version 2.2 of usfm.sty~~ _This task is now complete, and available in version 2.3.6_

==== Proposals ====
  * Enhance GoBibleCreator to be capable of processing SIL Fieldworks Translation Editor files, with source text format XHTML-TE. _This has been implemented by SIL, yet requires thorough testing_
  * Enhance GoBibleCreator to be capable of processing SWORD modules directly, making use of the [http://www.crosswire.org/jsword/ JSword] API to extract the Biblical text
  * Enhance GoBibleCreator to be capable of processing OSIS files in which chapter and verse XML tags are in the milestone form. Currently it supports only the container form for chapter and verse tags
  * Add option for GoBibleCreator to supply a specified MissingVerseText marker.
  * Extend the alternative icon support to have a separate icon for each collection
  * Make RedLetterMarkup for Words of Christ a build option in the collections text syntax. This is now done for USFM, but not for ThML source text format.

  * Allow a user interface translation to be specified as a path to a separate text file
  * Allow a book-name-map to be specified as a path to a separate text file


=== Build automation ===

  * Facilitate the compilation of both GoBible and GoBibleCreator together using a single make command
