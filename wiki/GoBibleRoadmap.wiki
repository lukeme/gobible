  * A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface GUI] for GoBibleCreator?
  * A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP PHP] script which converts source text into GoBibleDataFormat

  * ~~Provide support for alternative icon and application title, where the existing ones may present a cultural stumbling block~~ This task is now complete, and available in version 2.3.2
  * Update GoBibleCreator to build directly from USFM files that conform to version 2.2 of usfm.sty
  * Make RedLetterMarkup for Words of Christ a build option in the collections text syntax. This is now done for USFM, but not for ThML source text format.

=== Build automation ===
  * Develop an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant Apache Ant] utility to automate the build of multiple Go Bibles from source text files on any platform
  * Facilitate the compilation of both GoBible and GoBibleCreator together using a single make command
