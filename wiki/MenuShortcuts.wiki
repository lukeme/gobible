#summary Using the numeric keys as Go Bible menu shortcuts.

== Introduction ==

For many phones, with the Go Bible Menu selected, the numeric keys provide handy shortcuts.

No shortcut is required for the "Go to" option, as this is already selected by default.

For some phone models, the "Go to" option never appears in the menu, because it is accessed only via the joy-stick click.

===Preferences===
Whether "Go to" appears in the menu depends on whether *Fullscreen* is "On" or "Off". 

When it is "Off", "Go to" uses the left hand key below the display.
