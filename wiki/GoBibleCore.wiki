= Building =

Building JavaME applications can be difficult since they depend on various API libraries which may come from different sources depending on the platform you are developing on.

The first step is to check out the source code using SVN. Go to the *Source* tab above and follow the Google code instructions for how to use SVN to get the source.

Change into the GoBibleCore directory where you will find the `ReadMe.txt` file. The `ReadMe.txt` file contains additional instructions for configuring the build.xml file to successfully build GoBibleCore.
