= Introduction =

The *User Interface* (UI) for Go Bible consists of just over 70 short phrases listed in the [http://gobible.jolon.org/developer/GoBibleCreator/GoBibleCreator.html Go Bible Creator] page on the main Go Bible website.

Currently the UserInterfaceTranslations are managed in a piece-meal manner or not at all. One member even started a Google Docs spreadsheet, but this has not been updated since July 2007.


= Ini Translator? =

[http://initranslator.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Ini Translator] is a utility program to translate ini-style language files and has a look and feel reminiscent of poEdit (a great language editor for gnu gettext files). Ini-style language files are pretty common in Windows and are used by programs like Inno Setup, ISTool, FlashGet and Wallpaper Sequencer to name a few. The program runs on Windows 98/Me/XP/2000.

_I wonder if this could be easily adapted to manage the Go Bible UI translations?_
