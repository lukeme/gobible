== Introduction ==

The *User Interface* (UI) for Go Bible consists of 73 short phrases listed in the [http://crosswire.org/wiki/Projects:Go_Bible/UI_Translation Go Bible UI Translation] page on the !CrossWire Developers' wiki.

Currently the UserInterfaceTranslations are managed in a piece-meal manner or not at all.

One member even started a [http://spreadsheets.google.com/ Google Docs Spreadsheet], but this has not been updated since July 2007.


== Ini Translator? ==

[http://initranslator.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Ini Translator] is a utility program to translate ini-style language files and has a look and feel reminiscent of poEdit (a great language editor for gnu gettext files). Ini-style language files are pretty common in Windows and are used by programs like Inno Setup, ISTool, FlashGet and Wallpaper Sequencer to name a few. The program runs on Windows 98/Me/XP/2000.

_I wonder if this could be easily adapted to manage the Go Bible UI translations?_
