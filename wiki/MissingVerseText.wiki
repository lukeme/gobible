#summary How GoBibleCreator deals with missing verses

= Introduction =

If any verses are missing in a Bible translation, GoBibleCreator will misnumber the subsequent verses in the same chapter.


= Details =

Currently, a workaround is necessary.  The source text has to be edited, and a verse inserted with some dummy marker to denote that the verse is missing.

It would be desirable to automate this in GoBibleCreator, by adding an option in collections files to specify the marker for missing verses.
