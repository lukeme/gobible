#summary This page will list release notes for Go Bible Core and Go Bible Creator.

= Introduction =

For version history up to 2.2.3, refer to [http://gobible.jolon.org/news.html Go Bible News]

== 2.2.5 - 26 March 2008 ==

  * GoBibleCreator no longer takes ThML/OSIS files in as command line arguments. Instead the source text is specified in the Source-Text property in the Collections.txt file. However, if a ThML/OSIS file specified on the command line then GoBibleCreator will generate a Collections.txt file for it (but won't generate the actual collection JARs/JADs).
  * GoBibleCreator can now be run from a different directory and GoBibleCreator will still be able to locate the GoBibleCore directory which is in the same directory as the GoBibleCreator.jar.
  * Have added all Collections.txt files used to generate the collections on the Go Bible website to the repository.
  * Have begun adding source texts to the repository but have only got up to Hungarian as svn commit seems to be temperamental with large files.
  * Go Bible releases are now being tagged. The tag for this release is 2.2.5.

== 2.2.4 - 5 August 2007 ==
  _This build was available only by download from the Go Bible Google Group._

  * GoBibleDataFormat now uses shorts instead of bytes for start chapter and number of chapters.
  * GoBibleCreator will automatically generate a Collections.txt file if only a ThML/OSIS file is passed in as a parameter.
