= Introduction =

Please use this page to propose useful improvements to the main [http://go-bible.org/ Go Bible] website.

== Table of Go Bible downloads ==

I have made a survey of the downloads that are provided from the Go Bible site. There are some gaps in the table.

_This has been moved to the new GoBibleDownloadsTable page._


== Provide a more attractive image on the Go Bible home page ==

At present the only image is an animated GIF generated using microemulator.
The image contains no keyboard and nothing to suggest it is a cellphone display.
To catch and retain visitors' attention, the image should be replaced by one that is more immediately obvious as being that of the Go Bible application being used on a mobile phone.

== Provide installation help for special phone brands and models ==
  * Blackberry

== Go Bible Creator ==
References to UTF-8 as the required encoding for source text files and collection text files should state clearly that these must be UTF-8 *without BOM* (byte order marker)

=== Version 2.2.6 ===
  * Replace the download by the recompiled version

=== Version 2.3.2 ===
  * Add description of the new features, with a link to a new page to describe USFM
  * Update the download
