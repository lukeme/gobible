#summary The Go Bible Data Format

The JAR file contents:

  * {{{Bible Data/Index}}}
  * {{{Bible Data/[Book Name]/Index}}}
  * {{{Bible Data/[Book Name]/[Book Name] [File Number]}}} (these files contain the verse data)

Example for a collection which only contains the book of Matthew:

  * Bible Data/Index
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Index
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 0
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 1
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 2
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 3
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 4
  * Bible Data/Matthew/Matthew 5

The files named "Matthew n" contain the actual verse data. GoBibleCreator splits the verse data into multiple files to speed up file loading and also to limit the memory used. When a user searches or navigates in Go Bible the GoBibleCore will load each verse data file as it is needed releasing the previous one. This optimisation is probably not needed on modern devices which can load entire books into memory very quickly.

===The Global Index File: {{{Bible Data/Index}}}===

The file stored at {{{Bible Data/Index}}} is the Global Index File and contains the information needed by GoBibleCore to locate a chapter quickly.

It has the following format:

 * {{{byte}}} - Number of books
 * {{{[For each book]}}}
  * {{{utf}}} - Book display name
  * {{{utf}}} - Book's file name (used for both the book directory and verse data files)
  * {{{short}}} - Start chapter (This field is only used if a book must be split across different collections (ie. JAR files), this was a requirement when devices had JAR size restrictions smaller than the largest book (Psalms). As far as I am aware no MIDP 2.0 phone has a memory limit which requires books to be split. Nonetheless it is here if it is needed.)
  * {{{short}}} - Number of chapters (if the book has been split then this will contain only the number of chapters in this collection, but normally it will be the total number of chapters in the book)
  * {{{[For each chapter]}}}
    * {{{byte}}} - The file number which contains this chapter (so that GoBibleCore knows where to look for it)
    * {{{int}}} - Number of characters in the chapter (this is required so that GoBibleCore knows where in the verse data file a chapter begins)
    * {{{byte}}} - Number of verses in the chapter

===The Book Index File: {{{Bible Data/[Book Name]/Index}}}===

The Book Index File simply contains the length of each verse of every chapter. This is used to quickly locate a verse.

  * {{{[For each chapter]}}}
    * {{{[For each verse]}}}
      * short - Number of characters in the verse
