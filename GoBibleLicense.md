Even though the Google code project indicates that the source files are under the New BSD License they are actually in the public domain.

The reason for specifying New BSD License is because there is no option in Google code to specify public domain.

As far as we are currently aware the selection of the New BSD License in the Google code project options doesn't restrict the submission of files with other licenses.

This is an example of the type of comment at the top of each source file:

```
//
//  GoBibleCreator.java
//  GoBibleCreator
//
//  Created by Jolon Faichney on Sat Oct 30 2004.
//  For the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ and the furtherance of His Kingdom.
//  This file is placed into the public domain.
//
